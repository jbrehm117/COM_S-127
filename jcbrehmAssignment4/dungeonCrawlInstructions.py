    # TODO: In at least two of your rooms, make up a fun story for the player to read. Create a 'story' function which contains
    # text that you will print out, depending on which room the player enters. (1 pt.)
    #
    # HINT: The 'story' should probably only print out when the player has never visited to room before.

    # TODO: Create a function which implements a simple combat system for the game where the player fights monsters. Players and
    # monsters should take turns against one another. Not every room has to have combat in it. (1 pt.)
    #
    # HINT: You can accomplish this any way you want - use your imagination. However, it will have to print out/ take input for
    # whatever you want to have happen.
    #
    # HINT: You should at least have 'player total health'/ 'player current health'/ 'player damage' variables initially created
    # in the 'main()' function. You can pass these into the room functions, and then into the combat function.
    #
    # HINT: Whatever stats for whatever monsters you want to implement should likely exist inside the 'combat' function.
    #
    # HINT: Your combat function can, itself, call other sub-functions as well.

    # TODO: Create a function which implements a simple 'shop' for the player to pay some amount of gold to restore their health.
    # Not every room has to have a shop. (1 pt.)
    #
    # HINT: You can accomplish this any way you want - use your imagination. However, it will have to print out/ take input for
    # whatever you want to have happen.
    #
    # HINT: Perhaps players can also pay gold to upgrade their maximum possible health or their attack power.
    #
    # HINT: Whatever stats for shopping you want to implement should likelyh exist inside the 'shop' function.
    #
    # HINT: Your 'shop' function can, itself, call other sub-functions as well.

    # TODO: Create a function which accepts parameters representing the player's 'goldAmount' value, a 'gold' value representing
    # the amount of gold that the room contains, and a boolean flag indicating whether the room has been visited or not.
    #
    # This function will operate in a manner similar to the code below, and should return the new 'goldAmount' value that the
    # player has after adding the gold from the room to their total 'goldAmount'. It should also mark the 'room visited' boolean
    # flag as 'True', and return that value as well. When returning, assign the new amount of gold to the 'goldAmount' variable, and
    # assign the 'room visited' return value to the 'visited_room' variable. If the room has already been visited before, print
    # out a string indicating this.
    #
    # This function should be used in all subsequent room functions. (1 pt.)
    #
    # HINT: If the player's health is less than zero, they shouldn't be able to visit rooms anymore.

    # HINT: Study how the 'visited_room' variable is returned at the bottom of this function, and how it interacts with the
    # 'visited_roomX' variables in the main() function.

    # This function should be used in all subsequent room functions.
    # This function should return a valid 'roomChoice' value. (1 pt.)
    #
    # HINT: You can do this any way you want. However, it might be an easy solution to take in arguments that
    # specify valid directions for the player to move, and which rooms they can move to.
    # For example, arguments for N, S, E, W => 2, -1, 3, -1 might allow the player to move north to room 2,
    # and east to room 3. The values of -1 indicate that the player cannot move that direction.

    # There are multiple ways to go about this. You don't have to print all the commands on one line. Perhaps you could print out
    # each command on a different line, and then have the final prompt for the 'input' function just read "What is our choice?: "
